        <Section title="About smartcv">
          <p>
            smartcv is a free, open-source job application tracker built and operated by SmartCV Team
            (huynhnhan68). By creating an account and using smartcv, you agree to these terms.

        <Section title="The service">
          <p>
            smartcv is provided free of charge with no usage tier restrictions. You may use
            it to track your own job search activity. There is no guarantee of uptime,

          </p>
          <p>
            The AI Coach chat is limited to 20 messages per user per day to keep Bedrock costs
            manageable. This limit resets at midnight UTC.
